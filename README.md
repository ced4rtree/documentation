# Tator Tome

"Tator Tome" is the name given to the documentation written by Team 2122 in an
effort to preserve student knowledge post-graduation, as well as ensure that
various tooling and algorithms developed by the team don't fall by the wayside
as the years go on.

Documentation should strive to do a couple key things:

- Be novel

Documentation already created by WPILib, CTRE, or any other first party
documentation provider, is almost guaranteed to be more well written and better
maintained than anything we write. Good documentation should cover things not
covered by other documentation, such as unique algorithms or processes.

- Be useful

Documentation should be filled with as much information as is needed to ensure
a student can recreate the solution from only knowledge of basic robot
programming. If there is not enough information, the documentation might as
well not exist. If there is too much information, one might consider breaking
their document into multiple pages, lest a reader become overwhelmed and give
up.
